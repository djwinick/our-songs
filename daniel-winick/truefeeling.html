        <h1>True Feeling</h1>
        <h2>Galantis</h2>
            <p>It's cold out, take my coat now<br>
            I wore just for you<br>
            Oh oh oh oh<br>
            Oh oh oh oh<br></p>
            <p>I feel you in my bones now<br>
            Feel you through and through<br>
            Oh oh oh oh<br>
            Oh oh oh oh<br></p>
            <p>It might get hard when you're growing older<br>
            But I'll be here and I'll be your shoulder<br>
            I can see it now<br>
            I can see it now<br></p>
            <p>And oh my God, hope it never changes<br>
            I'll spend my life trying to recreate this<br>
            But I don't know how<br>
            No I don't know how<br></p>
            <p>It's me and you, ooh<br>
            A true feeling, it's a true feeling<br>
            It's me and you, ooh<br>
            A true feeling, it's a true feeling<br></p>
            <p>Go wild, let your hair down<br>
            What you got to lose?<br>
            Oh oh oh oh<br>
            Oh oh oh oh<br></p>
            <p>We both need fixing<br>
            But they can't fix what's true<br>
            Oh oh oh oh<br>
            Oh oh oh oh<br></p>
            <p>Oh my God, hope it never changes<br>
            I spend my life tryna recreate this<br>
            But I don't know how, no I don't know how<br>
            It's me and you, ooh<br></p>
            <p>A true feeling, it's a true feeling<br>
            It's me and you, ooh<br>
            A true feeling, it's a true feeling<br>
            And I still remember that night in September<br>
            Ooh, it's a true feeling, true feeling<br></p>
